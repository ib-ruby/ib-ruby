Plan:

1. IB#send_message method should accept block, thus compressing subscribe/send_message
pair into a single call - to simplify DSL.

2. IB Connection uses delays to prevent hitting 50 msgs/sec limit:

3. IB Connection reconnects gracefully in case if TWS disconnects/reconnects

4. Messages should be Models as well (audit trail), @received_at timestamp in messages

5. Detailed message documentation

6. Move Float values to Decimal (roundoff errors showed in spec!)


Done:

1. Create integration tests for basic use cases

2. IB#subscribe should accept regexes.

3. Compatibility with API v.966, 967

4. Collect all received messages in Connection#received[:type] by default

5. Flow handlers: Connection#wait_for / Connection#received?

6. Add ActiveRecord backend to all Models

7. Make ActiveModel-like attributes Hash and serialization for tableless Models


Ideas for future:

1. Decouple Broker-specific Adapter from universal high-level messaging layer
(potentially adding other broker adapters)

2. Tweak IB::Message API for speed (use class methods)

3. Create integration tests for more use cases (spec/README)
