1. Create integration tests for basic use cases

Plan:

2. Make ActiveModel-like attributes Hash for easy attributes updating

3. IB#send_message method should accept block, thus compressing subscribe/send_message
pair into a single call - to simplify DSL.

4. IB Connection uses delays to prevent hitting 50 msgs/sec limit:

5. IB Connection reconnects gracefully in case if TWS disconnects/reconnects

6. Compatibility check for new TWS v.966

Done:

2. IB#subscribe should accept regexes.

Ideas for future:

1. Decouple Broker-specific Adapter from universal high-level messaging layer
(potentially adding other broker adapters)

2. Tweak IB::Message API for speed (use class methods)
