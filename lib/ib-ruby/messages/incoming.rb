      # :status - String: Displays the order status. Possible values include:
      # • PendingSubmit - indicates that you have transmitted the order, but
      #   have not yet received confirmation that it has been accepted by the
      #   order destination. NOTE: This order status is NOT sent back by TWS
      #   and should be explicitly set by YOU when an order is submitted.
      # • PendingCancel - indicates that you have sent a request to cancel
      #   the order but have not yet received cancel confirmation from the
      #   order destination. At this point, your order cancel is not confirmed.
      #   You may still receive an execution while your cancellation request
      #   is pending. NOTE: This order status is not sent back by TWS and
      #   should be explicitly set by YOU when an order is canceled.
      # • PreSubmitted - indicates that a simulated order type has been
      #   accepted by the IB system and that this order has yet to be elected.
      #   The order is held in the IB system until the election criteria are
      #   met. At that time the order is transmitted to the order destination
      #   as specified.
      # • Submitted - indicates that your order has been accepted at the order
      #   destination and is working.
      # • Cancelled - indicates that the balance of your order has been
      #   confirmed canceled by the IB system. This could occur unexpectedly
      #   when IB or the destination has rejected your order.
      # • Filled - indicates that the order has been completely filled.
      # • Inactive - indicates that the order has been accepted by the system
      #   (simulated orders) or an exchange (native orders) but that currently
      #   the order is inactive due to system, exchange or other issues.
      # :why_held - This field is used to identify an order held when TWS is trying to
