      # • PendingSubmit - indicates that you have transmitted the order, but
      #   have not yet received confirmation that it has been accepted by the
      #   order destination. NOTE: This order status is NOT sent back by TWS
      #   and should be explicitly set by YOU when an order is submitted.
      # • PendingCancel - indicates that you have sent a request to cancel
      #   the order but have not yet received cancel confirmation from the
      #   order destination. At this point, your order cancel is not confirmed.
      #   You may still receive an execution while your cancellation request
      #   is pending. NOTE: This order status is not sent back by TWS and
      #   should be explicitly set by YOU when an order is canceled.
      # • PreSubmitted - indicates that a simulated order type has been
      #   accepted by the IB system and that this order has yet to be elected.
      #   The order is held in the IB system until the election criteria are
      #   met. At that time the order is transmitted to the order destination
      #   as specified.
      # • Submitted - indicates that your order has been accepted at the order
      #   destination and is working.
      # • Cancelled - indicates that the balance of your order has been
      #   confirmed canceled by the IB system. This could occur unexpectedly
      #   when IB or the destination has rejected your order.
      # • Filled - indicates that the order has been completely filled.
      # • Inactive - indicates that the order has been accepted by the system
      #   (simulated orders) or an exchange (native orders) but that currently
      #   the order is inactive due to system, exchange or other issues.
      # :why_held - This field is used to identify an order held when TWS is trying to

      ### Actual message classes (long definitions):

      # The IB code seems to dispatch up to two wrapped objects for this message, a tickPrice
      # and sometimes a tickSize, which seems to be identical to the TICK_SIZE object.
      #
      # Important note from
      # http://chuckcaplan.com/twsapi/index.php/void%20tickPrice%28%29 :
      #
      # "The low you get is NOT the low for the day as you'd expect it
      # to be. It appears IB calculates the low based on all
      # transactions after 4pm the previous day. The most inaccurate
      # results occur when the stock moves up in the 4-6pm aftermarket
      # on the previous day and then gaps open upward in the
      # morning. The low you receive from TWS can be easily be several
      # points different from the actual 9:30am-4pm low for the day in
      # cases like this. If you require a correct traded low for the
      # day, you can't get it from the TWS API. One possible source to
      # help build the right data would be to compare against what Yahoo
      # lists on finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ticker under the "Day's Range"
      # statistics (be careful here, because Yahoo will use anti-Denial
      # of Service techniques to hang your connection if you try to
      # request too many bytes in a short period of time from them). For
      # most purposes, a good enough approach would start by replacing
      # the TWS low for the day with Yahoo's day low when you first
      # start watching a stock ticker; let's call this time T. Then,
      # update your internal low if the bid or ask tick you receive is
      # lower than that for the remainder of the day. You should check
      # against Yahoo again at time T+20min to handle the occasional
      # case where the stock set a new low for the day in between
      # T-20min (the real time your original quote was from, taking into
      # account the delay) and time T. After that you should have a
      # correct enough low for the rest of the day as long as you keep
      # updating based on the bid/ask. It could still get slightly off
      # in a case where a short transaction setting a new low appears in
      # between ticks of data that TWS sends you.  The high is probably
      # distorted in the same way the low is, which would throw your
      # results off if the stock traded after-hours and gapped down. It
      # should be corrected in a similar way as described above if this
      # is important to you."
