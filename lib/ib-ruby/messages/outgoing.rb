      #
      # The server providing historical prices appears to not always be
      # available outside of market hours. If you call it outside of its
      # supported time period, or if there is otherwise a problem with
      # it, you will receive error #162 "Historical Market Data Service
      # query failed.:HMDS query returned no data."
      #
      # For backfill on futures data, you may need to leave the Primary
      # Exchange field of the Contract structure blank; see
      # http://www.interactivebrokers.com/discus/messages/2/28477.html?1114646754
