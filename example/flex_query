# FLEX is a web-based service from IB that helps you to retrieve your activity,
# trades and positions. It is working independently from TWS or Gateway, using your
# internet connection directly. See /misc/flex for extended FLEX documentation.
# 
# In order to use this service, activate it and configure your token first.
# Your Token is located at Account Management->Reports->Delivery Settings->Flex Web Service. 
# You need to activate Flex Web Service and generate new token(s) there.
# Your Flex Query Ids are in Account Management->Reports->Activity->Flex Queries. 
# Create new Flex query and make sure to set its output format to XML.
# 
# This script runs your pre-defined FLEX query and prints the resulting report
