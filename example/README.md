## IB-RUBY EXAMPLES:

This folder contains sample scripts that demonstrate common ib-ruby use cases.
The scripts show you how to access account info, print real time quotes, retrieve
historic or fundamental data, request options calculations, place, list, and cancel orders.
You may also want to look into `spec/integration` directory for more scenarios,
use cases and examples of handling IB messages.

Normally you run these examples like this:

    $ ruby example/list_orders

If you're on Unix-like platform, you can make these files executable.
