This program requires a TWS running on localhost on the standard port
that uses API protocol version 15 or higher. Any modern TWS should
work. (Patches to make it work on an arbitrary host/port are welcome.)

----------

One argument is required: --security, the security specification you want, in
"long serialized IB-Ruby" format. This is a colon-separated string of the format:

   symbol:security_type:expiry:strike:right:multiplier:exchange:primary_exchange:currency:local_symbol

Fields not needed for a particular security should be left blank (e.g. strike and right are only relevant for options.)

For example, to query the British pound futures contract trading on Globex expiring in September, 2008,
the correct command line is:

  ./RequestHistoricData.rb --security GBP:FUT:200809:::62500:GLOBEX::USD:

Consult datatypes.rb for allowed values, and see also the examples in the symbols/ directory (load them in
irb and run security#serialize_ib_ruby(ib_version) to see the appropriate string.)

***

Options:

--end is is the last time we want data for. The default is now.
  This is eval'ed by Ruby, so you can use a Ruby expression, which must return a Time object.


--duration is how much historic data we want, in seconds, before --end's time.
  The default is 86400 (seconds, which is 1 day.)
  The TWS-imposed limit is 86400 (1 day per request.) Requests for more than 86400 seconds worth of historic data will fail.

--what determines what the data will be comprised of. This can be "trades", "midpoint", "bid", or "asked".
  The default is "trades".

--barsize determines how long each bar will be.

Possible values (from the IB documentation):

 1 = 1 sec
 2 = 5 sec
 3 = 15 sec
 4 = 30 sec
 5 = 1 minute
 6 = 2 minutes
 7 = 5 minutes
 8 = 15 minutes
 9 = 30 minutes
 10 = 1 hour
 11 = 1 day

 Values less than 4 do not appear to work for some securities.
 The default is 8, 15 minutes.

--nonregularhours :
 Normally, only data from the instrument's regular trading hours is returned.
 If --nonregularhours is given, all data available during the time
 span requested is returned, even data bars covering time
 intervals where the market in question was illiquid. If


--dateformat : a --dateformat of 1 will cause the dates in the returned
 messages with the historic data to be in a text format, like
 "20050307 11:32:16". If you set it to 2 instead, you
 will get an offset in seconds from the beginning of 1970, which
 is the same format as the UNIX epoch time.

 The default is 1 (human-readable time.)

--header : if present, prints a 1 line CSV header describing the fields in the CSV.

--veryverbose : if present, prints very verbose debugging info.
--verbose : if present, prints all messages received from IB, and print the data in human-readable
  format.

 Otherwise, in the default mode, prints only the historic data (and any errors), and prints the
 data in CSV format.

### Parameters

# DURATION is how much historic data we want, in seconds, before END_DATE_TIME.
# (The 'duration' gem gives us methods like #hour on integers.)
DURATION = (opt["duration"] && opt["duration"].to_i) || 1.day

if DURATION > 86400
  STDERR.puts("\nTWS does not accept a --duration longer than 86400 seconds (1 day.) Please try again with a smaller duration.\n\n")
  exit(1)
end


# This is the last time we want data for.
END_DATE_TIME = (opt["end"] && eval(opt["end"]).to_ib) || Time.now.to_ib


# This can be :trades, :midpoint, :bid, or :asked
WHAT = (opt["what"] && opt["what"].to_sym) || :trades

# Possible bar size values:
# 1 = 1 sec
# 2 = 5 sec
# 3 = 15 sec
# 4 = 30 sec
# 5 = 1 minute
# 6 = 2 minutes
# 7 = 5 minutes
# 8 = 15 minutes
# 9 = 30 minutes
# 10 = 1 hour
# 11 = 1 day
#
# Values less than 4 do not appear to actually work; they are rejected by the server.
#
BAR_SIZE = (opt["barsize"] && opt["barsize"].to_i) || 8

# If REGULAR_HOURS_ONLY is set to 0, all data available during the time
# span requested is returned, even data bars covering time
# intervals where the market in question was illiquid. If useRTH
# has a non-zero value, only data within the "Regular Trading
# Hours" of the product in question is returned, even if the time
# span requested falls partially or completely outside of them.

REGULAR_HOURS_ONLY = opt["nonregularhours"] ? 0 : 1

# Using a DATE_FORMAT of 1 will cause the dates in the returned
# messages with the historic data to be in a text format, like
# "20050307 11:32:16". If you set :format_date to 2 instead, you
# will get an offset in seconds from the beginning of 1970, which
# is the same format as the UNIX epoch time.
